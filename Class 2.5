1.4 Product Scope
<Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.
Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. 
If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.



2.2 Product Functions
<Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform.
Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. 
Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. 
A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram,
is often effective.>
