"You sit 'pon the floor, stranger.  The floor of a modest home in Southwark.  Southwark being a dot on a map of England.  England being a nation in the temporal world, and the temporal world being a location you must yourself interpret the nature of.  I find your accent unplaceable, and I, being a listener by virtue and trade, am implaccable when it comes to the unexpected and the new.  Of which you number both.  Enrobe thyself and I shall impose you upon my brothers, who shall upbraid me for being untimely anon."

:: Approach and introduce yourself {"position":"1375,1725","size":"100,100"}
"Can I help you?" Redd asks without looking up, then freezes when he sees your face. Recognition flickers in his eyes, though you've never met.

"I... do I know you?" he asks, voice uncertain.

When you introduce yourself, he sets down his tools with careful precision. "Strange. I feel like we've met." He laughs nervously. "Been having the oddest dreams lately. About a house that stood here, long ago."

His eyes search yours. "Someone very like you was in them. Not exactly you, but... similar somehow."

"The dreams?" Redd runs a hand through his hair. "They started months ago. At first, just fragments—unfamiliar streets, people in old-fashioned clothes."

He leans closer. "But lately, they're more vivid. I'm watching someone called William Redbrook. He lives in a house that stood exactly where this building is now."

His eyes search yours. "There are others here who have similar dreams—Nichole in accounting dreams of a man named Nicholas. Margueritte in R&D dreams of a woman named Margaret."

He takes a shaky breath. "And we're all witnessing some kind of catastrophe. A tearing in the fabric of time itself."

:: Ask about the building {"position":"2100,1625","size":"100,100"}
"This building?" Billie's eyes sparkle with mischief. "It stands on interesting ground. Temporal thin spot, you might say."

She leads you to a window, pointing to the foundations. "They dug up all sorts of curiosities when they built this place. Old fragments, objects that shouldn't exist."

She leans closer, voice dropping. "The company uses the energy fluctuations for their research. Probably don't even realize what they're really tapping into."

Her smile fades momentarily. "There's a test scheduled today. Major one. I've had... dreams about it. Not the good kind."

/* rawContent */background: spr_background, character: WB_future_serious


:: Ask about the future {"position":"2375,2500","size":"100,100"}
Will's expression darkens. "The future? What's left of it, you mean."

He gestures at the ravaged landscape visible through a gap in the walls. "After the Temporal Collapse, the world... fractured. Different times bleeding into one another, creating pockets of chaos."

He leans closer. "This settlement exists in a stable bubble. Outside, time flows differently in different zones. Step in the wrong place, and you might age decades in seconds. Or reverse. Or shatter into temporal fragments."

His eyes lock with yours. "We three remnants—the last echoes of those who once were William, Nicholas, and Margaret—we're trying to fix it. The past is the key."

:: Ask about the key {"position":"2325,750","size":"100,100"}
"Ah, the key!" William snags it from your hand with nimble fingers before you can protest. "One of many such objects that... bend certain rules."

He flips it casually, catching it without looking. "Found it, did you? Or perhaps it found you."

He returns it with unexpected gentleness. "These objects appear to those standing at crossroads. People whose choices matter more than most."

His expression grows briefly serious. "I've seen similar artifacts in Nicholas's records. And Margaret has been studying them for years." He winks. "Make of that what you will."

:: Ask about the key {"position":"2175,2600","size":"100,100"}
"The brass key." Will's voice drops to a reverent whisper. "The only artifact to survive the Collapse wholly intact."

He reaches toward it, fingers trembling, but stops short of touching it. "We've been searching for it—or someone who could wield it—for generations."

His eyes meet yours. "According to our histories, this key was at the epicenter of the Collapse. And yet it remained, while everything else fractured."

He looks at you with newfound intensity. "If you truly came from before the Collapse, and the key brought you here... it means there's hope. The cycle might be broken."

:: Ask about the Remnant Council {"position":"2375,2600","size":"100,100"}
"The Council? Three of us, one from each lineage." Will gestures at himself. "I represent the line of Chaos-Makers. Those who in every era push boundaries."

He points to a meticulously organized corner where a figure works. "Nik preserves knowledge, creates order from our chaos. Their predecessors were always the record-keepers."

Will nods toward the settlement's edge, where someone peers through a makeshift telescope. "And Mag scouts the temporal boundaries, maps the stable zones. The adventurers, always seeking."

His voice grows quiet. "We're not exactly them—your William, Nicholas, and Margaret. But we carry their... resonance. Their purpose."

:: Ask about her work {"position":"2100,550","size":"100,100"}
Margaret's eyes light up at your question. "Finally, someone interested in the work rather than the oddity!"

She gestures to the workbench, covered in brass mechanisms, sketches, and tools you don't recognize.

"I'm studying the boundaries between times," she explains. "These objects—" she indicates several items similar to your key, "—they appear at weak points in the temporal fabric."

She draws a complex symbol on a piece of paper and hands it to you. "If you find yourself lost again, look for this mark. It will guide you to safety."

:: Ask about her work {"position":"1950,1425","size":"100,100"}
"My work?" Nichole seems surprised by your interest. "Nothing particularly exciting. I track resource allocation across departments."

She warms to the topic. "Though lately I've been assigned to monitor the experimental energy system. It's quite fascinating—the fluctuations follow patterns I can't quite explain."

She pulls out a tablet, showing you graphs of energy spikes. "See these recurring sequences? They're almost like..."

She stops, embarrassed. "This will sound odd, but they remind me of my dreams. The same patterns, the same... rhythm."

[[Say you're not sure]]

:: Ask how she knows about anomalies {"position":"2075,1825","size":"100,100"}
"Know about anomalies?" Margueritte's laugh is warm. "I've been studying them for years. The company thinks I'm researching energy fluctuations."

She studies your face carefully. "You've experienced one, haven't you? Met someone from another time? Perhaps someone who reminded you of me?"

At your reaction, she nods. "I'm not connected to anyone in the past directly. But there are... echoes. People with similar traits, similar purposes."

She turns back to the view. "Time isn't as linear as most people think. It's more like..." She gestures at the sprawling city below. "A landscape where similar types of people appear in similar roles, again and again."

:: Ask how to get back {"position":"2525,2550","size":"100,100"}
Will exchanges glances with Nik, who has approached silently.

"Back?" Nik's voice is soft but precise. "There may be no 'back' to return to. When you left your time, you created a branch. That branch may no longer exist."

Will grimaces at Nik's bluntness. "What they mean is, the key doesn't just transport you through time—it moves you between potential timelines."

"Our records," Nik continues, "suggest the key responds to need more than desire. It brought you here for a reason."

Will nods. "If that reason involves preventing the Collapse... you might create a new timeline entirely. One where none of this happened."

:: Ask how to get home {"position":"2050,675","size":"100,100"}
"Home?" Margaret considers the concept. "Temporal displacement isn't like physical travel. You can't simply retrace your steps."

She picks up the brass key you found. "These objects are anchors of a sort. They appear to those caught between times."

She hands it back carefully. "Keep this with you. When the time is right—when you've done what you're meant to do here—it may guide you back."

Her expression grows serious. "But be warned: some who travel between times never find their way home. They become... untethered."

/* rawContent */background: house_past, character: MT_past_serious


:: Ask how you're different {"position":"1850,550","size":"100,100"}
Margaret studies you with scientific intensity. "The others came through because they were chosen—pulled across time by William's meddling or my devices."

She circles you, observing from different angles. "But you... you seem to have fallen through naturally. A genuine temporal anomaly."

She reaches out as if to touch your shoulder, then thinks better of it. "That makes you either incredibly dangerous or incredibly valuable. Perhaps both."

Her expression softens slightly. "It also means you might be able to return home. Eventually."

:: Ask if she remembers you {"position":"2200,1475","size":"100,100"}
"Remember you?" Billie tilts her head, studying you carefully. "Not exactly. But you feel familiar."

She taps her temple. "I have these dreams—another life, another time. I see someone named William Redbrook who encounters visitors like you."

Her expression shifts between curiosity and concern. "He's not me, obviously—we couldn't be more different in many ways—but we share a certain... wavelength."

She glances around the modern office. "The dreams are getting stronger. More real. Especially since they started testing that new system in the basement."

:: Ask Nicholas about himself {"position":"1700,1250","size":"100,100"}
"About myself? How refreshingly direct." Nicholas smiles, pouring tea into delicate cups.

"I was a clerk for the East India Company. Meticulous with details, excellent memory—useful qualities in my position."

He hands you a cup. "Then I started experiencing visions I couldn't explain. Events from decades before my birth, glimpses of what seemed like the future."

His expression grows thoughtful. "William found me having a rather public episode in a coffeehouse. Brought me here, showed me I wasn't alone."

He sips his tea. "Now I document our temporal observations. Every visitor, every anomaly."

:: Ask Nicholas about this place {"position":"1700,1175","size":"100,100"}
"This place?" Nicholas gestures around them. "Mundane enough on the surface. A house in Southwark, where our little company of temporal observers makes its home."

He leads you to a window. "But it stands at a crossing point of times. Thin walls between years, if you will."

He turns back to you. "William finds those who slip through. Margaret studies how and why. I keep the records—histories of visitors like yourself, patterns in the temporal fabric."

His smile is gentle but knowing. "We've been expecting something unusual. The boundaries have been weakening of late."

:: Ask about Nicholas's dreams {"position":"1700,1100","size":"100,100"}
"Dreams?" Nicholas considers your question carefully. "Yes, I suppose I have been having rather peculiar ones lately."

He arranges papers on his desk as he speaks. "I find myself recording events I couldn't possibly have witnessed. Ancient Rome. The court of Elizabeth. The Great Fire."

His methodical movements pause. "And recently, dreams of a future so strange I lack words to properly describe it. Metal carriages without horses. People carrying tiny paintings that speak and change."

He looks up, his gaze penetrating. "You're from there, aren't you? That impossible future."

You ask your ersatz host five questions at the same time, but all that surfaces is a hoarsely muttered "gruuhhhmuhhh." --"Here, strange being.  You look parched." --The owner of the smirking voice hands you a glass of water and you gulp it down with as much dignity as you can muster.  It's not much.

"Ah, the others!" William claps his hands together. "My brothers and sister in temporal mischief. They'll be delighted to meet you."

He leads you through winding passages, the house seemingly larger inside than its exterior suggested.

"Nicholas handles the records—cataloguing the when and where of it all. Margaret builds the mechanisms—she understands the key better than any of us."

He pauses at a doorway. "Together, we watch the boundaries between times. And lately, those boundaries have been... troublingly thin."

:: Ask to meet the others {"position":"2550,2450","size":"100,100"}
"The others? Of course." Will gestures for you to follow.

He leads you through the settlement, a patchwork of architectural styles cobbled together from temporal debris. Buildings made from materials of different eras stand side by side, somehow holding together despite their incongruity.

At a structure that appears to be part medieval guild hall, part modern laboratory, and part something unfamiliar, Will pauses.

"Fair warning—Nik and Mag will have questions. Many questions. They've been waiting for someone like you for longer than any of us can remember."

:: Ask what he means by "not much time" {"position":"575,1875","size":"100,100"}
"The dreams are getting more frequent," Redd explains, voice low. "At first, just fragments every few weeks. Now it's almost nightly."

He runs a hand through his hair. "And I'm not the only one. Nichole from accounting, Margueritte in R&D—they've been experiencing the same thing."

He points to a date on his phone calendar—today. "Something's happening. The building's experimental energy system is running a test at 3:00 PM, and in my dreams..."

He meets your eyes. "In my dreams, that's when everything tears apart."

:: Ask why you're here {"position":"2450,850","size":"100,100"}
William's expression sobers slightly. "Why are you here? That's the question, isn't it?"

He drums his fingers against his thigh, considering. "The boundaries between times are weakening. You're caught in the fracture."

His eyes meet yours, suddenly serious. "Something's coming. Something that will require people who can move between times to prevent catastrophe."

He leans forward. "The question isn't why you're here. It's what you'll do now that you are."

The world dissolves around you in a kaleidoscope of fracturing reality. You tumble through a void filled with fragments of times—broken scenes from history, glimpses of possible futures, moments that never were.

The brass key burns in your hand, its heat increasing until you fear it will melt through your flesh. Yet somehow, you maintain your grip.

The tumbling stops abruptly. You find yourself sprawled on hard ground beneath an alien sky. The air smells of dust and ozone.

As your vision clears, you see a figure approaching—human, but oddly dressed in a patchwork of materials that don't belong together.

"Another visitor," the figure says, voice warm with unexpected recognition. "And with the key, no less. I'm Will. Welcome to what's left of the world."

The notification mentions a "comprehensive systems diagnostic" scheduled for 3:00 PM today, focusing on the building's experimental energy management system.

The message is signed by the head of Research & Development, Dr. T. Fracture.

A strange chill runs through you as you read the name. Something about this test feels connected to what Redd told you about temporal boundaries weakening.

As you gather your temporal allies, patterns emerge that cannot be coincidence:

William Redbrook, Billie Rochelle-Ross, and maintenance worker "Redd" Beck—all chaotic forces drawn to adventure and disruption.

Nicholas Drayton, Nichole Draytone, and records manager Drait Niki—all organized observers who bring structure to chaos.

Margaret Ashford, Margueritte Travers, and research lead M.A.Sh.T—all adventurous powerhouses driven to conquer new frontiers.

"We're not reincarnations," Margueritte explains, examining Margaret's symbol. "More like... complementary frequencies across time. When temporal boundaries weaken, we resonate."

"Like instruments playing the same note in different octaves," adds Nichole.

Redd grins. "Or like cosmic troublemakers who keep finding each other."

"You feel it too, don't you?" they ask without preamble. "The thinning of boundaries."

They gesture to a device humming in the corner. "This will either seal the breaches permanently or..." they hesitate, "...accelerate the process. I'm not entirely sure which."

The scientist looks from face to face, recognition dawning. "So it's true. The temporal echoes manifesting as spiritual counterparts."

"You must stop this experiment," Margueritte says firmly.

"The temporal boundaries are already too weak," adds Nichole, showing data on her tablet.

"We've seen what happens if you continue," Redd finishes.

Dr. Fracture hesitates, then nods slowly. "I've had... dreams. About catastrophic outcomes." They power down the device. "Perhaps some knowledge isn't worth the cost."

The chamber is a physical contradiction—ancient wooden beams supporting transparent plastic panels, stone floor inlaid with circuitry, light provided by both flames and softly glowing technology you don't recognize.

Three figures await you. Will, whom you've met. A meticulously dressed person with a tablet made of paper and metal who must be Nik. And a tall, scarred individual wearing practical gear festooned with tools—Mag.

"The Visitor has arrived," Will announces, with unexpected formality.

Nik steps forward. "You hold the key that bridges times. Our histories say this moment would come."

Mag's eyes gleam. "The question is whether you're here to witness our end, or to prevent it."

The threads of time converge as you gather your temporal allies from both past and present—three distinct personality types, repeated across centuries.

As Dr. Fracture's device activates, temporal boundaries begin to collapse. With the brass key in hand, you face a critical choice.

William/Billie/Redd offer chaotic inspiration: "Break all the rules if you must."

Nicholas/Nichole/Drait provide careful analysis: "Consider every consequence before acting."

Margaret/Margueritte/M.A.Sh.T urge bold action: "Whatever you choose, commit fully to it."

The building shakes. Emergency alarms blare. You understand now—this is the moment your temporal allies warned about.

As others flee, you move against the tide, toward the source of the disturbance. The brass key burns hot in your pocket.

You find the temporal fracture in the basement—reality itself tearing open, past and present bleeding together.

You know what must be done. Using the key as Margaret and Margueritte showed you, you seal the breach with yourself inside.

Your body disintegrates across a thousand years, but time stabilizes.

In two different centuries, your six allies—three pairs of temporal echoes—raise a glass to your memory.

It hums with increasing intensity. Near it stands a clipboard with a countdown: 15 minutes until activation.

Looking closer, you notice familiar symbols etched into its frame—the same patterns you saw on Margaret's workbench in 1847.

"I've been expecting you," she says, grabbing her tablet. "The test—it's not what they think it is."

She shows you schematics of the device. "These patterns appeared in my dreams for months. I tried to warn them, but..."

Her fingers trace symbols identical to what Margaret showed you in 1847. "This will tear open the boundaries between times permanently if we don't stop it."

She checks her watch. "We have ten minutes. We need to find Redd and Nichole, now."

Something goes wrong during the crisis. The key slips from your grasp at the crucial moment.

You find yourself drifting, untethered from time. Moments flow around you—snippets of lives, fragments of history, glimpses of futures that may never come to pass.

You try to scream, but sound requires time to travel. You try to move, but motion requires time to occur.

You exist everywhere and nowhere, watching the world but unable to touch it. Occasionally, you glimpse familiar faces—William, Nicholas, Margaret, and their modern counterparts—searching for you across centuries.

She pivots suddenly, eyes flashing with intelligence and barely-contained energy. Her sleeves are rolled up, hands stained with various substances, a leather apron protecting clothes that seem designed for movement rather than fashion.

"Margaret Ashford. You're displaced. Temporally." She states this as fact, not question. "Interesting. You're different from the others." Her confidence and directness make it clear she's accustomed to taking charge of unusual situations.

When she spots you, she abruptly abandons her audience mid-story, making a beeline toward you.

"Finally!" she says, as if continuing a conversation. "I've been waiting for someone interesting to show up."

Her grin is eerily reminiscent of William Redbrook's, though they can't possibly be related across centuries. "You've got that look. Like you've seen the impossible."

She turns at your approach—tall, confident, wearing practical clothes that somehow look perfectly professional. Her eyes light up at the sight of you.

"Well," she says, voice rich with an adventurer's spirit. "I was wondering when the next anomaly would appear."

Margueritte Travers extends her hand firmly. "I've been observing the temporal disturbances for months. You've experienced one, haven't you?"

You find yourself face to face with Nichole Draytone. Something about her strikes you as familiar—not her appearance, but her methodical movements, the organized stack of files she carries, the thoughtful look in her eyes.

Her organizational style reminds you of Nicholas, though they couldn't possibly be connected across centuries.

Her voice lowers. "Sometimes I'll be working on the quarterly reports, and suddenly I'm certain I've done it all before—but not here. Somewhere... older."

He lowers his voice, glancing around to ensure you're not overheard. "Nichole from accounting has been documenting energy fluctuations that match exactly what happens in my dreams. And Billie from marketing—she's been drawing sketches of objects from another time."

He runs a hand through his hair. "We've talked about it, but we thought we were just... I don't know, sharing a delusion? But if you've seen what we've seen..."

He looks up at you. "It's like we're connected across time. Not the same person, but... echoes of each other. Playing similar roles in different centuries."

His expression hardens with sudden resolve. "We need to find the others. Now."

:: Temporal fracture death {"position":"1225,2050","size":"100,100"}
The experimental device activates before you can reach it. Reality seems to fold in on itself around you.

You try to scream but no sound emerges. Your body feels simultaneously compressed and stretched, as if existing in multiple places at once.

Through the haze of agony, you catch glimpses—London streets, your office, places you've never seen—all superimposed like multiple exposures on a single photograph.

With terrible clarity, you realize: you're being pulled apart across time itself.

:: Threaten him for straight answers {"position":"2300,975","size":"100,100"}
William's laugh is bright and genuine in response to your threats.

"Oh, I like you! Such spirit!" He circles you with casual disregard for personal space. "Threats won't get you anywhere useful, but they certainly make things interesting."

He plucks an apple from a bowl and tosses it to you. "Let's make a game of it instead. For every question you ask, I'll give one honest answer and one lie."

His eyes sparkle. "Your challenge is figuring out which is which."

:: Try to disable the device {"position":"950,1650","size":"100,100"}
You approach the device carefully, looking for an off switch or power source to disconnect.

As your hands near the apparatus, the hum intensifies. The brass components begin to glow with familiar warmth, reminding you of the key in your pocket.

A projection appears—temporal data flowing across the lab walls. With shock, you recognize Margaret's symbols from 1847 in the equations.

Suddenly, your phone buzzes with messages from building security—Redd, Nichole, and Margueritte are all looking for you, urgently.

The countdown shows 5 minutes remaining.

:: Try to stop the experiment {"position":"1550,1625","size":"100,100"}
"Stop!" you shout, lunging for the device's power supply.

Dr. Fracture moves with surprising speed to block you. "You don't understand what's at stake!"

As you struggle, the scientist's form seems to flicker—momentarily revealing someone older, with eyes that have seen too many centuries.

"The boundaries must be eliminated," they insist. "Time itself is a prison I've sought to escape for too long."

The device powers up with a whine that hurts your ears. Through the lab windows, you see reality flickering—glimpses of the building as it was centuries ago.

Your temporal allies burst in, but it may be too late.

You hold out the brass key, focusing on your desire to prevent the Temporal Collapse.

The key glows, first warm, then hot, then painful—but you maintain your grip. The Remnant Council watches with expressions ranging from hope to determination.

"It's responding!" Will exclaims.

"The resonance patterns are aligning," Nik confirms, consulting their strange device.

Mag steps forward. "Focus on the moment before the Collapse. On Dr. Fracture's device. On the error that must be corrected."

The world begins to shimmer around you. The last thing you see before reality dissolves is the three Remnants joining hands, accepting that their existence may be erased by your success.

:: Try to use the key on the device {"position":"1550,1750","size":"100,100"}
As the device activates, you press the brass key against its central component.

The reaction is immediate—energy surges between the two objects, creating a visible distortion in the air around you.

Through this ripple, you see glimpses of other times—William Redbrook, Nicholas Drayton, and Margaret Ashford all watching with expressions ranging from concern to fascination.

The distortion grows, threatening to tear reality apart rather than bridge it. Dr. Fracture shouts something you can't hear above the temporal roar.

The key burns in your hand as you face a critical choice.

:: Try to use the key to leave {"position":"2425,1100","size":"100,100"}
You grasp the key firmly, willing it to transport you away from this madman.

William observes with academic interest. "Fascinating. You think it works on command?"

The key remains inert. William nods, unsurprised.

"These objects have their own will, in a sense. You'll go when it's ready, not before."

He smiles sympathetically. "Until then, I'm afraid you're stuck with me. Shall we start again? I promise to be marginally more straightforward."

You pull out the brass key, focusing on your desire to return home.

William watches with interest. "Not as simple as that, I'm afraid. These objects have their own timing."

The key remains inert in your palm. William nods, unsurprised.

"It brought you here for a reason. You'll return when that purpose is fulfilled."

His smile returns, mischievous. "Until then, you might as well get comfortable. Time passes differently here—you won't miss much back home."

:: Use the brass key on the device {"position":"825,1700","size":"100,100"}
Acting on instinct, you place the brass key against the device's central component.

The reaction is immediate—a surge of energy that knocks you backward. The key and device seem to resonate together, creating a visible distortion in the air.

Through this ripple, you see glimpses of other times—William Redbrook in his home, Margaret at her workbench, Nicholas cataloging his observations.

But the connection is unstable. The distortion grows, threatening to tear reality apart rather than bridge it.

A voice calls your name—Redd has found you, his face pale with recognition and fear.

You press the brass key against the device's humming core.

The reaction is violent—a surge of energy knocks you backward as time itself seems to ripple around you. Through the distortion, you glimpse all three sets of your allies across centuries.

The device's hum becomes a scream. Dr. Fracture shouts something you can't hear.

The key burns in your hand as the temporal fracture widens, threatening to tear reality apart rather than mend it.

You realize what must be done, but the cost will be high.

:: Use the brass key with your allies {"position":"1675,1475","size":"100,100"}
With your temporal allies gathered, you produce the brass key. It glows with unexpected warmth.

"The temporal anchor," Margueritte whispers. "If we combine our connections across time..."

Redd nods. "A bridge instead of a barrier."

As Dr. Fracture's device activates, the key floats from your palm. Your modern allies join hands with you while you see ghostly images of their historical counterparts overlapping them—not the same people, but spiritual echoes playing similar roles across centuries.

The key expands into a glowing portal—not an ending, but a beginning. A controlled connection between times rather than a catastrophic collapse.

Dr. Fracture stares in wonder. "This changes everything."

You step back, watching as the device cycles through its warm-up sequence. The air around it seems to thicken, light bending strangely near its brass components.

Your phone buzzes repeatedly—urgent messages from Redd, Nichole, and Margueritte, all converging on your location.

The countdown reaches one minute.

Through the lab windows, you see reality flickering—momentary glimpses of the same space in different times. The wooden beams of an old house. Empty land before construction.

The key in your pocket grows hot, resonating with the device.

Your temporal allies burst in together, eyes wide with recognition of what's happening.

You decide to step away, preserving the strange peace of this moment. As you turn to leave, Redd suddenly calls out:

"Wait!"

He looks up, startled by his own outburst. "I... I don't know why I did that."

He studies your face intently. "Have we met? You seem... I've been having these dreams lately. About a house that used to stand here."

He laughs nervously. "Sorry. That must sound crazy."

"And who are you?"

A smirking voice opens your eyes, and you're faced with a stranger.

You look around and realize, not only is the person you're looking at a complete unknown to you, but your surroundings are unfamiliar. Is this some kind of film set? Wooden fixtures decorate a cozy, homey, --WAIT! what the heck is going on!

The man bows with theatrical flair. "William Redbrook, at your service. I collect interesting anomalies—temporal visitors being the most interesting of all."

Will speaks first. "We need you to return to the moment of the Collapse. To stop Dr. Fracture's experiment from destroying the timeline."

"Our histories suggest the device was meant to stabilize temporal boundaries," Nik adds, "but something in the calibration was fundamentally flawed."

Mag approaches, holding a small object assembled from mismatched parts. "This tracker contains everything we know about what went wrong. The key will take you back—this will help you fix it."

"But understand," Will says gently, "if you succeed, our timeline—our very existence—will be erased. A small price for saving billions of lives."
